## **PHP INTRODUCTION**

PHP stands for Hypertext preprocessor. The PHP scripts are executed on the server XAMPP-Apache. PHP is noted for generating
page content in which it can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server. Likewise, PHP can collect form
data. PHP can add, delete, modify database. Lastly, PHP can encrypt data.

I choose PHP programming language through version XAMPP 8.1.6. I pick PHP because I deal with data and CSV files at work.
These CSV files I will put on the SharePoint web site to share with other departments.

## **PHP HANDLING**

OOP feature continually added to PHP which has full class-based OOP support which facilitates the creation of objects
through the use of classes and class declarations. PHP object characterized by identity, state, and behavior. The file
in PHP presented as a resource that can be passed around to other functions to read and write to the file. In PHP two
conditionals check the file opening by file handle returned by fopen(); likewise, if opening file failed fopen()returns
false. PHP conditional statements in PHP utilize the keywords if, else, and else if where conditions are placed inside
parentheses immediately after the if and else if keywords. On the other hand, in PHP logical statements are built using 
the standard logical operators for numeric comparisons as well as logical operators such as negations, AND, and OR.
Finally, PHP supports while loops, for loops, and do-while loops using the keywords while, for, and do; whereas continuous
conditions for loops are enclosed in parentheses with blocks of code associated with the loop are enclosed in curly
brackets.
